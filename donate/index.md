# 💡 Support GoCL

I’m based in Zambia, where Stripe and PayPal are not supported.  
If you'd like to help power GoCL’s development (hardware, backups, power costs), see below:

### 🔗 Liberapay
[![Donate via Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/thee3rdplayer/widget.svg)](https://liberapay.com/thee3rdplayer/)

Note on LiberaPay: LiberaPay is used here as a buffer platform—it provides a simple, established infrastructure to collect donations and link potential supporters until direct payment methods become available. It acts like an intermediary “holding area,” leveraging its approach to route contributions reliably.

### 💬 Why It Matters

GoCL is built to optimize GPU compute across AMD, NVIDIA, and potentially Apple — designed for regions where proprietary tools are limited or expensive.  
Your support directly fuels development under power cuts, limited access to tools, and global payment walls.
